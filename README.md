# CyberCity Webpage

I wanted to brush up and polish my CSS skills on this project. I focused mainly on media query and a mobile-first approach.
I was inspired to do a retro video game store site as video games are one of my favorite past times and the color scheme I chose
to work with also seems like it is a good fit for a site such as this.
